# Stress Detection Senior Design Project iOS Application 
## (ie. PowerPorterIOS)
This repo contains the source code for an iOS application that interacts with the hardware for our senior design project at the University of Texas. The application is tailored towards a wearable bluetooth device (due to COVID, CSVs are used to transfer data) made by our group containing 3 sensors: a ROS sensor for detecting blood pressure and heartrate, a GSR sensor for skin conductance, and an accelerameter for catching noisy data. The repo for that device will be <<here>>.
