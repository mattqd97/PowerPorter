# Stress Detection Senior Design Project iOS Application 
## (ie. PowerPorterIOS)
This repo contains the source code for an iOS application that will amoung other things display lInE gRaPhs. The application is tailored towards a wearable bluetooth device made by our group containing (hopefully) 4 sensors: a GMR sensor for detecting heartrate, a ROS sensor for detecting blood pressure, a GSR sensor for skin conductance, and an accelerameter for catching noisy data. The repo for that device will be <<here>>. 
  
## Overview
This section provides documentation for the app

### Main View
Tab view

### Bluetooth
Yeah

## For Angelos
Use the source control in xcode pls

## Todo
